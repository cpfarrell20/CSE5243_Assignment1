# CSE5243_Assignment1
Code and report for Assignment 1, Problem 2. 

The following packages need to be installed for the program to run effectively:
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
scipy
matplotlib

pip install -r [name of package]

The test1.py file contains the tests for steps 1-4, where I confirmed the size of the matrices/vectors, etc.
full_eval.py is how I tested the overall program and found the data in the report, and I ran it using py full_eval.py
